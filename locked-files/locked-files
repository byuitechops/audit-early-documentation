# Project Capture Document for Audit: Locked Files
#### *Author: Jake Schwantes*

## Background
<!-- 
Explain the context of the problem.
Explain key terms/words, words that may be unfamiliar to a new hire.
Do Example: 
    
    Corey and his team have been manually going through the html for all images in canvas and entering alt image text.
    This has been very time consuming.
Don't Example:
    Without project templates, we have been left with readmes that share all different kinds of data, and some of them were missing key
    points of data. Additionally, we have no standard for code templates. We don't want to add a lot of overhead to setting up a project
    with templates and code setup.
-->
-----
Some classes after their conversion could have a problem with not having certain files being locked or opening at the wring times. This could be a problem because not having files in a class could be a big issue for students who need to access those files for homework or to learn. We want to avoid this issue. This audit will make an api call to get all of the files and check to make sure that their locks match their blueprint's lock dates.

## Definition of Done
<!-- 
What is/are the project outcome(s)?
("Can you give me one sentence describing what you want done?")
We are trying to clean up the yard by Mow, Edge, and Rake.
Do Example:
    We are creating a tool to find all images that are in need of alt text in canvas 
    which will automate this process by showing an image and prompting for alt text.
Don't Example 2:
    We are using yeoman to create a generator that will add all needed documentation and
    set up the code with all needed scripts, templates, and integrations.

We are creating this audit so we can check whether the locks on assignments are set up correctly. We will be making the API call to get all the files for the course and the blueprint course. If there are locks, we will make sure the file locks match. If they do not match, this audit will fail.
