# Project Capture Document for Audit: Blueprint Turned On
#### *Author: Cameron Thompson*
#### *Stakeholder(s): Dan Gordon*
#### *Date: 2019 July 8, 15:55*
## Background
<!-- 
Explain the context of the problem.
Explain key terms/words, words that may be unfamiliar to a new hire.
Do Example: 
    
    Corey and his team have been manually going through the html for all images in canvas and entering alt image text.
    This has been very time consuming.
Don't Example:
    Without project templates, we have been left with readmes that share all different kinds of data, and some of them were missing key
    points of data. Additionally, we have no standard for code templates. We don't want to add a lot of overhead to setting up a project
    with templates and code setup.
-->
Durring copy, a semester blueprint might not get turned on. Making copies for the semester sections is okay but any changes to the semester blueprint might not carry over to the semester sections, making the students miss important changes to their course.

## Definition of Done
<!-- 
What is/are the project outcome(s)?
("Can you give me one sentence describing what you want done?")
We are trying to clean up the yard by Mow, Edge, and Rake.
Do Example:
    We are creating a tool to find all images that are in need of alt text in canvas 
    which will automate this process by showing an image and prompting for alt text.
Don't Example 2:
    We are using yeoman to create a generator that will add all needed documentation and
    set up the code with all needed scripts, templates, and integrations.
-->
This audit will go and check to see if the semester blueprint has the blueprint setting turned on.
