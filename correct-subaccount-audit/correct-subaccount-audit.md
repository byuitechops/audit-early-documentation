## Background
It is important for courses to be in the right locations when students are looking for them. It would be bad if a student was enrolling for their classes and wasn't able to find the classes they needed to take. This audit will make sure that the courses are in the right place (e.g. CS124, CS165 and other CS classes are sub accounts to the main Computer Science Department).

-----
## Definition of Done
This audit will go through the courses and make sure that their sub accounts are in the right places.
