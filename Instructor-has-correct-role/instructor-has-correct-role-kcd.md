# Preliminary Design

## Magic Box Chart

<!-- Think through the process as much as makes sense, and then create a magic box chart with the whiteboard and place it here. -->

## Explanation of Design
The audit will get a list of course ID's. The aduit will loop through each of the course ID's and will get the list of users that are enrolled as online instructors from canvas api. Then the audit will check if that list is greater than 0. If it is then the course will pass the audit. Otherwise it will fail.


### Used Libraries
Canvas API Wrapper

## Things to Consider Before Getting Project Approved
- Are there any approved libraries that I can use? [Link to Approved Library List]
- Are there design patterns that will help?  [Link to Design Patterns]
- Can I design it so that it is a general tool instead of a specific solution?
- How can it be easily expanded?
- What does the minimum viable product look like?

## Prep for Learning Phase
- What do I need to learn
- How will I learn it
- What will I do to learn it (prototypes/tutorials/research time limit?)
- What is the definition of done for my learning process
- How do I measure the progress of learning
- Is there a deliverable that can be created during the learning process?

## Component Diagrams
<!-- Diagrams and companion explanations for all Key Components.
These would include information about inputs, outputs, and what a function does for every major function. -->

<!-- For each component, the following template will be followed: (In other words, the template below will repeat for each component)-->

<!-- Diagram Types:
 - Data Flow (I think this will be the most popular)
 - Structure Charts (This is really good for showing input and output of every function)
 - UML Class Diagram (a must for object oriented projects) -->
