## Background
Many of the courses have a short course description in order to help students understand a bit more about the course. The description is optional for a course to have (?). This audit will check to see if a course's description in Canvas is the same as in the CX data (BYU-I Server Data).

-----
## Definition of Done
This audit will check the courses to see if they contain a course description, and if they do, it will check it against CX to ensure it is correct.

-----
# Requirements
