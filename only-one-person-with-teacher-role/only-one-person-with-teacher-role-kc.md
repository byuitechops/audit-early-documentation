## Magic Box Chart

![Magic Box](TeachersBox.jpg)

## Explanation of Design
<!-- Add explanation of the Magic Boxes image above. Answers to the prompts below may also be appropriate to include here. -->
This Audit will make the `/api/v1/courses/:course_id/users?enrollment_type[]=teacher` call from canvas to get a list of Teachers. We will count this to find the number of teachers in the course. There will be conditional logic that will pass the audit only if the number of teachers is equal to one. Else, the audit will fail. A corresponding message will be returned.

### Used Libraries
- The canvas wrapper (Comming soon).

## Things to Consider Before Getting Project Approved
- Are there any approved libraries that I can use? [Link to Approved Library List]
- Are there design patterns that will help?  [Link to Design Patterns]
- Can I design it so that it is a general tool instead of a specific solution?
- How can it be easily expanded?
- What does the minimum viable product look like?

## Prep for Learning Phase
- What do I need to learn
- How will I learn it
- What will I do to learn it (prototypes/tutorials/research time limit?)
- What is the definition of done for my learning process
- How do I measure the progress of learning
- Is there a deliverable that can be created during the learning process?

## Component Diagrams
<!-- Diagrams and companion explanations for all Key Components.
These would include information about inputs, outputs, and what a function does for every major function. -->

<!-- For each component, the following template will be followed: (In other words, the template below will repeat for each component)-->

<!-- Diagram Types:
 - Data Flow (I think this will be the most popular)
 - Structure Charts (This is really good for showing input and output of every function)
 - UML Class Diagram (a must for object oriented projects) -->
