## Magic Box Chart

![Key Components for: hidden courses don't have enrollments audit](images/hidden-courses-have-no-enrollments1.jpg)

<!-- Think through the process as much as makes sense, and then create a magic box chart with the whiteboard and place it here. -->

## Explanation of Design
<!-- Add explanation of the Magic Boxes image above. Answers to the prompts below may also be appropriate to include here. -->
This audit takes a course code as a parameter. For each course it will make an API call to `api/v1/courses/{courseCode}/?include[]=total_students` and check the `is_public` property of that course. If it's set to `false`, meaning it is hidden, it will check if there are any students enrolled in that course by checking the `total_students` property. If it's greater than 0 there are students and the audit will fail. Any other case it will pass.

### Used Libraries

<!-->
## Things to Consider Before Getting Project Approved
- Are there any approved libraries that I can use? [Link to Approved Library List]
- Are there design patterns that will help?  [Link to Design Patterns]
- Can I design it so that it is a general tool instead of a specific solution?
- How can it be easily expanded?
- What does the minimum viable product look like?
## Prep for Learning Phase
- What do I need to learn
- How will I learn it
- What will I do to learn it (prototypes/tutorials/research time limit?)
- What is the definition of done for my learning process
- How do I measure the progress of learning
- Is there a deliverable that can be created during the learning process?

## Component Diagrams
<!-- Diagrams and companion explanations for all Key Components.
These would include information about inputs, outputs, and what a function does for every major function. -->

<!-- For each component, the following template will be followed: (In other words, the template below will repeat for each component)-->

<!-- Diagram Types:
 - Data Flow (I think this will be the most popular)
 - Structure Charts (This is really good for showing input and output of every function)
 - UML Class Diagram (a must for object oriented projects) -->
